himdcli interface

Funny it's late for now i just wanted to share my code and maybe find some bash fan that is willing to contribute. 

I know the existense of qhimdtransfer but i can only download files with it. himdcli gives this same option so 

I decided to write a script around it. then stumbled on dialog and had some fun the last days. now i stumble on git 

which i've visited before but did not know what i came to do here, now i want to use it so i will investigate asap.


And now the script  i run ubuntu  i used avplay formal ffplay for playback i tried mplayer but prefer avplay ok
basic things like awk cat sed are needed but also bc is used and ofcource dialog
